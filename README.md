# Target.Array (Fairground Gallery Shooter)

## Idea

I wanted to create a simple game that been scaled to have more complex features. The idea of a point and click shooter came to mind. The arcade version of Time crisis was my original influnce however I knew that would be to complex for this task. From arcades, I started to think about fairgrounds and the mini games they had. This is how I got to a gallery shooter
